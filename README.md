# Gene expression-FEOBV uptake change in smokers
This is a repo in support of Julia's Honour's thesis


## Analysis
The plan is to correlate the FEOBV SUVR change in left hemisphere to nicotinic (and maybe other genes involved in cholinergic system) gene expression. The assumption is that the change in FEOBV SUVR in smokers is dependent on some nicotinic receptor distribution

## Data
The [data](data/) folder contains the following files/directories:
- [FEOBVPET](data/smoking_pctdiff.nii.gz): this file contains the percentage difference between smokers and healthy controls
